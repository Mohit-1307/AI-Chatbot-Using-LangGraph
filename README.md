## 🤖 LangGraph Agent Lab
From Zero to Production-Ready Agentic Workflows
A hands-on, structured learning repository for building agentic AI systems using LangGraph, LangChain, and Ollama.
This project is designed as a mini-course on agents — progressing from stateless graphs to memory, tools, multi-agent systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

🚀 Why This Repository?

✔ Structured like a real agent engineering course

✔ Focuses on thinking in graphs, not chains

✔ Covers state, tools, memory, and reasoning

✔ Uses local LLMs (Ollama) — no API dependency

✔ Ideal bridge from ML / LLMs → Agentic AI

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

This repository is ideal for:

✔️ Developers learning LangGraph

✔️ ML engineers moving into LLM agents

✔️ Engineers building RAG & AI assistants

✔️ Learners who want mental models, not magic
